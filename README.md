# 🔥 Alberta Wildfire Prediction Model

Wildfires in Alberta pose a serious threat every year. This project uses public wildfire data to **analyze patterns and predict the final severity of wildfires** based on:

- 📅 Month
- 📍 Geographic location
- 🔥 Cause of wildfire
- 🌤️ Weather conditions

We hope this model can help relevant authorities **allocate resources more effectively** and respond in a timely manner.
