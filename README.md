# Alberta_Wildfire_Model
Because wildfires in Alberta are very serious every year, I obtain public data for analysis and build a model to predict the final severity of wildfires based on the month, geographical location, cause of the wildfire, and weather. We hope that this model can help relevant personnel invest resources in a timely manner.

Explaination for files:

0. Background and case study file floder: These files are the case studies from public resource. These help to understand the background and why we want to start do data analysis and modeling for this topic.
1. Datasets:
   af-historic-wildfires-1996-2005-data.csv & fp-historical-wildfire-data-2006-2023.csv/xlsx - Raw data from open data in public website - Alberta Government. Using the data from 2006-2023 in this project.
   Pdf file is the data dictionary from this website.
   For doing next analysis, author did some cleansing by the SQL query, for importing to Power BI.
   The Excel data dictionary is written by the author and contains the cleaned fields and derived fields. At the same time, another table contains the list of fields used in the model.
