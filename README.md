# Alberta_Wildfire_Model
Because wildfires in Alberta are very serious every year, I obtain public data for analysis and build a model to predict the final severity of wildfires based on the month, geographical location, cause of the wildfire, and weather. We hope that this model can help relevant personnel invest resources in a timely manner.

**Explaination for files:**
